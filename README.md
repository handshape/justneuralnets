# Introduction 
JNN is a cluster of projects geared towards getting the complicated parts of neural-net classifiers encapsulated in an easy-to-use set of tools.

# Getting Started
JNN is a Java 17 application that uses Maven for build and dependency management. You will need:
1.	A Java Development Kit -- we recommend Adoptium.
2.	Apache Maven -- many IDEs already bundle Maven.

# Build and Test
To build and test JNN, ensure that both Java and Maven are installed and on your path, and type:
```
mvn clean install
``` 
If you want to build the full project site, use:
```
mvn clean install site
``` 

# Contribute
As always, the code needs more tests, documentation, and user feedback. Feel free to contribute!
